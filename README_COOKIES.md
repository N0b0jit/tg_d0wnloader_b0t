# How to Fix "Private / Invalid Link" Errors

If you are getting "Failed to download media" errors for Instagram or other sites, you likely need to export your browser cookies. This allows the bot to "sign in" as you and view the content.

## Step 1: Install a Cookie Editor
- **Chrome:** Install "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" extension.
- **Firefox:** Install "cookies.txt" extension.

## Step 2: Export Cookies
1. Log in to Instagram.com (or the site giving you trouble) on your browser.
2. Open the extension.
3. Click "Export" to download the `cookies.txt` file.

## Step 3: Add to Bot
1. Rename the downloaded file to exactly `cookies.txt`.
2. Move it into this folder: `c:\Users\Nobojit\Desktop\pythonbotcode\`
3. **Restart the bot** (`start.bat`).

The bot will now automatically detect `cookies.txt` and use it to download media!
